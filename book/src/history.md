# History of Bitcoin

As Satoshi Naamoto stated in [his paper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf), Bitcoin is "_A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution._"

For these reason, Bitcoin needs to be seen in the context of *money*, *cryptography*, and *computer science*.

Here we list some important dates in the history of Bitcoin, including events involving money, important milestones on cryptography and computer science.

## 1933
In April, 5 Roosvelt [signs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102) the Executive Order 6102, which forbids the hoarding of gold coins, gold bullion, and gold certificates within the continental United States. The order criminalized the possession of monetary gold by any individual, partnership, association or corporation.

## 1936
Alan Turing publishes his paper ["On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem"](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/Turing_Paper_1936.pdf), which introduced the concept of a Turing machine. The paper is widely acknowledged as the foundation of computer science and artificial intelligence.

## 1972
[Nixon's shock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_shock) announcement of the cancellation of the direct international convertibility of the United States dollar to gold.

## 1974
The paper ["A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1092259) is published by Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn. The paper describes a protocol for sharing resources using packet-switching among the nodes.

## 1976
["New Directions in Cryptography"](https://www-ee.stanford.edu/~hellman/publications/24.pdf) paper is published by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman. The paper describes a new method of distributing cryptographic keys, which went far toward solving one of the fundamental problems of cryptography, key distribution.
The paper also introduced a concept of asymmetric key cryptography (or public key cryptography).

## 1978
The paper ["A Method for Obtaining Digital Signatures and Public-Key Cryptosystems"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) is published by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman. The paper describes a public key cryptosystem based on the computational difficulty of factoring prime integers.
