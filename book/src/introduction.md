# Introduction

This is the companion book of [BTCR](https://github.com/nicolafiorillo/btcr), a Bitcoin node writter in Rust for educational purposes.

Currently, the book is a work in progress. The goal is to have a documentation that explains the concepts of a Bitcoin node in a way that is easy to understand for developers with little to no experience in Bitcoin.

For now it contains scattered notes and code snippets.

The book is written in Markdown and built with [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/index.html).
